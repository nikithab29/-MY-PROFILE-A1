## INTEREST IN IT

I am a huge fan of technology and always love to play around with it and learn new skills. I find it really interesting how much technology has changed our lifestyles in so many ways and how it made it easier to perform certain daily tasks. I have researched a lot of careers in Information technology, and hearing other people’s experiences and journey in the workforce really sounded exciting to me. I love the idea of being able to work from home and being able to travel around the world working in different countries. I believe that a career in Information Technologies gives individuals various opportunities to enhance their knowledge of Technology as well as being able to have a flexible working environment. 

Growing up in a generation with the rise of new technologies, I was always interested in playing around and exploring online games. This grew the curiosity within me on how certain technologies are developed and how they can help us in our daily lives whether it is for work, entertainment or to complete daily tasks. In my final year of primary school, I was given the opportunity to use an Ipad to help me with my learning, which helped me to learn new skills with different softwares such as microsoft. This sparked an interest in me to explore all the options which various softwares provide to help me with my work to perform my best. I have always loved messing around and learning new things on my own, clicking on random buttons and learning their functions. 
Since the beginning of high school,  IT was a subject that I chose every year till Year 12, and was my most favourite class. In Year 8, we were learning to develop a website and had to be extremely creative presenting the information and features. After that we also did animation which was more entertaining. Further over the years, we explored many different IT concepts which I found interesting to learn and would never miss a class and was always looking forward to learning new things. At home, my parents call me tech-savvy and they usually seek my help to get around with certain things relating to IT, although it is small tasks. 

I chose to study at RMIT University because it is one of the leading universities in Melbourne and is ranked 14th in Australia. I have heard that it is a very good institution to study Information Technology from previous students and friends and family. I have also researched a lot throughout my highschool about RMIT and the opportunities they have open for students from all around the world. When I came to know that RMIT offers lots of different Information Technology courses, I looked into it and found it very engaging. I believe that by studying at RMIT, I can accomplish my dreams and achieve a good career in IT with the help of my tutors and friends around me. 

During my studies, I expect to expand my knowledge and skills I have learnt in Information Technology at highschool. I want to explore how the world of technology works and how it can make great impacts in our lifestyle in the present and future generations. I want to enhance my knowledge in coding and certain softwares that lots of companies require as a skill to have in certain roles. 
Through my final years of high school, I researched courses I would like to do in lots of different universities all over Victoria. By word of mouth and lots of research and other people’s personal experiences, I learnt that RMIT was a very friendly and engaging university, where Information Technology is a very popular course. 

After graduation I hope to get work as a graduate entry in a company that requires skills and knowledge obtained from my bachelor degree. I hope to gain experience and learn new skills working in that company and move on to other jobs with the experience I gained. I would love to travel around the world working for different companies learning new things and exploring different cultures as well as meeting new people that work in the same field all around the world.

I can highly relate to the Myers-Briggs test the most amongst all 3 tests I took. Although at times I do like socializing and working with others, I am really more of an introverted person who enjoys my own company. I am very observant with things that happen around me and can have mixed emotions at times. As the learning styles results predicted, I am a visual learner and tend to learn things more through seeing pictures or watching demonstrations or through observational learning. I struggle to get things in my head when someone teaches me by reading something out loud or explaining information without any visual imagery. 

I feel that these results may have a great impact on my behavior when working with a team. As an introverted character, I might struggle to socialize with others in a team. However, getting out of my comfort zone and having a mindset to work hard for my goals would help me to get better at this. Setting goals for myself, interacting with other team members, and telling them how I feel about things could possibly help me to build great relationships with my team members which would boost my confidence to work hard in group projects. 

I need to be more aware that I am not working individually, but with other team members who rely on me and expect work to be done from my side too in order to fulfill great scores for assignments and other class activities. Likewise, in a working environment, I should actively engage in group projects and interact with my co-workers. I personally feel like by doing this I can also increase my self-esteem and boost my confidence in socialising and working with others. 

## PROJECT IDEA

The project will be creating a money saver app using the MIT App Inventor. The purpose of this app is to help users save money monthly just like a money box  but an online version. Whilst banks provide you with a savings account to save money, you could be tempted to take money out of those accounts anytime. Likewise, having a physical money box  could also be tempting to take money out regardless of having a lid to open it or not. This app should allow individuals to save money by locking the account after they have put money in, restricting access for the user until a set date. 

I recently started working and getting my own payment, and I always wanted to find a way to save money without myself taking from my savings. So when my parents suggested starting a savings account, I was not too fond of it as I knew that I might end up taking money from it at one point. As I child I had my own piggy bank as well, but instead of saving money it was more like an object to store money in like a bigger version of a purse because I kept taking money from it. One day, I was scrolling through social media, I came across a video where a girl saves 5000 dollars in a month by adding a certain amount of money each day and putting it in a box. I thought this was cool, but instead of making a physical box it would be cool if we had an app to store our money in and which cannot access for a certain amount of time just like we have screen time on our phones. 

The app opens to a spin wheel with numbers labeled from 1 to 100. The user will spin the wheel and whichever number the wheel lands on is the amount of money they have to put into their savings that day. Once the wheel has landed on one of the numbers, that number will disappear the next day so that the user won’t have to put the same amount of money in again or multiple times in a row. Once all numbers have been drawn, the user gets to unlock the account and have it open for 2 days. In the 2 day timeframe, the user won't be able to add any money to their account but instead can withdraw money if they wish. Another way the user can unlock their account would be by setting a goal, such as a trip to Bali, and setting a timeframe to which day they want to save for that trip. It’s just like creating a music playlist. 

The software that I will be using to develop my money saver app is the MIT App Inventor. I will be using canva to create some aesthetic backgrounds as well to make it more attractive to users. 

If the app is successful, then users would be able to save a huge amount of money within a short-term. It will prevent their habit of taking money from savings accounts or personal piggys banks and allow them to save more money and prioritize their financial responsibilities more efficiently. The impact of this development would be low sales on piggy banks at stores as well as banks having less customers taking a savings account.
